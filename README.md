## Overview

As data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance, our task is to help financial analysts by creating some of the visualizations for a stock profile of Netflix.

## Goal

Create and deliver visualizations of  Netflix data to help the financial analysts assess the risk of the Netflix stock.

#Action

- Explore, prepare, and plot Netflix data for the year 2017. 
- Visualize the distribution of the stock prices for Netflix in 2017
- Visualize and summarize Netflix stock and revenue for the past four quarter.
- Visualize and briefly summarize the earned versus actual earnings per share.

## Data

Codecademy provided us with three csv files: `NFLX.csv`, `DJI.csv`, and `NFLX_daily_by_quarter.csv`.
- The data is represented by days.
  - For `NFLX`: earliest date:2017-01-01 and latest date: 2017-12-01.
  - For` DJI`: earliest date:2017-01-01 and latest date: 2017-12-01.
  - For `NFLX_daily_by_quarter`: earliest date: 2017-01-03 and latest date: 2017-12-29. 
- While the NFLX and DJI present data for the first day of each month of the year 2017, NFLX_daily_by_quarter presents daily stocks information for year 2017.
- In addition to the columns of netflix_stocks, the netflix_stocks_quarterly data has a Quarter column.
